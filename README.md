# DatabasePractice

Date: 2/13/2023

This program is designed to demonstrate how to use a database with a WPF program.

## How to Run
* Press the play button in Visual Studio to run the program.
* Once the console opens, a screen showing two buttons will be displayed alongside an area for text to print.
* Pressing the buttons will print different tables from the Database.
* Press the X in the upper right corner of the window to exit.

## Design Decisions
* The TextBox overrwrites the previous text when you press the other button.
